## ðŸ§­ Core Project Documents

This project is guided by a set of living documents that track our progress, plans, and learnings. These are the primary sources of truth for our work:

1.  **[Project Summary (`PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`)](PROJECT_SUMMARY.md)**
    *   **Purpose:** A high-level overview of the project, suitable for resumes and external showcases.
    *   **Content:** Defines the project's objectives, technologies, key achievements, and clearly outlines our respective roles as Project Lead and AI Development Partner.

2.  **[Development Roadmap (`docs_ROADMAP.md`)](docs_ROADMAP.md)**
    *   **Purpose:** The strategic plan outlining all development phases, from initial setup to future features.
    *   **Content:** Contains a detailed, section-by-section breakdown of tasks. We will follow this roadmap to guide our development priorities.

3.  **[Lessons Learned (`LESSONS_LEARNED.md`)](LESSONS_LEARNED.md)**
    *   **Purpose:** A project retrospective and journal.
    *   **Content:** We continuously update this document with key learnings, mistakes, and important decisions. It helps us reflect on our process and improve as we go.

##  VISION

### ðŸ§  Machine Learning & Strategy Engine
The core of this project is an adaptive strategy engine. The system will:
-   Monitor the performance of its strategies.
-   Incorporate robust risk management, including stop-losses and take-profits.
-   Evolve to potentially adjust parameters or strategies based on performance data.

### ðŸ“Š Reporting & Monitoring
A key goal is to have clear, data-rich reporting. This includes:
-   A daily digest summarizing trades, performance, and key statistics (P/L, drawdown, etc.).
-   The digest should be professional and clear, suitable for external review.

### âœ¨ Future Ambitions: A Premium Dashboard
While not an immediate priority, a long-term goal is to develop a sleek, modern, and interactive dashboard (e.g., using Streamlit) to visualize the bot's performance and operations in real-time. The design philosophy should be clean and professional.
