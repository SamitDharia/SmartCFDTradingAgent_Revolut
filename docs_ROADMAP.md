# SmartCFD Trading Agent - Project Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan for the SmartCFD Trading Agent, an automated trading bot using the Alpaca Markets API.

---

## âœ… Phase 1: Core Functionality (Completed)

### Section 1: Foundational Setup & Configuration
- [x] Initialize project structure, `pyproject.toml`, and basic directories.
- [x] Implement a robust configuration management system (`smartcfd/config.py`).
- [x] Set up structured logging (`smartcfd/logging_setup.py`).
- [x] Create initial Docker setup (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`).

### Section 2: Core Trading Components
- [x] Define abstract base classes for `Broker` and `Strategy`.
- [x] Implement `AlpacaBroker` for paper trading.
- [x] Implement a `DryRunStrategy` for testing the system's core loop.
- [x] Create the main `Trader` class to orchestrate the components.

### Section 3: Initial Integration & Testing
- [x] Write unit tests for configuration, broker, and strategy components.
- [x] Implement the main application runner (`docker/runner.py`).
- [x] Ensure the `Trader` loop runs correctly in the Docker container.

### Section 4: Risk Management
- [x] Implement a `RiskManager` class.
- [x] Define risk parameters in the configuration (e.g., max drawdown, position size).
- [x] Integrate `RiskManager` into the `Trader` to approve/reject trades.

### Section 5: Live Paper Trading
- [x] Connect to Alpaca's paper trading API using environment variables.
- [x] Successfully execute a full trading loop: Strategy -> Risk Manager -> Broker.
- [x] Verify that the bot can run continuously and handle API interactions.

### Section 6: Baseline ML Model
- [x] Create a data loading module (`smartcfd/data_loader.py`).
- [x] Develop a script to train a baseline model (`scripts/train_model.py`).
- [x] Create an `InferenceStrategy` that loads and uses the trained model.
- [x] Integrate the `InferenceStrategy` into the live trading loop.

## âœ… Phase 2: Enhancement & Intelligence (Completed)

### Section 7: Reporting & Monitoring
- [x] **Daily Digest:** Create a script that generates a daily summary of trades, performance, and decisions.
- [x] **Notifications:** Implement an email service to send out the daily digest and critical alerts.
- [x] **Dashboarding:** Develop a simple web-based dashboard to visualize performance metrics and trade history.

### Section 8: Advanced Modeling & Prediction Accuracy
- [x] **Feature Engineering:** Enhance the feature set in `smartcfd/indicators.py` with more sophisticated technical indicators (e.g., Bollinger Bands, MACD, RSI).
- [x] **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Implement `RandomizedSearchCV` to find optimal settings for models.
- [x] **Experiment with Advanced Models:** Replace `RandomForestClassifier` with a tuned `XGBoost` model.

### Section 9: Robustness & Safety Mechanisms
- [x] **Overfitting Mitigation:** Implement feature importance analysis and use `TimeSeriesSplit` for more robust cross-validation suitable for financial data.
- [x] **Volatility & "Black Swan" Defense:** Implement a circuit breaker in the `RiskManager` based on Average True Range (ATR) to halt trading during extreme volatility.

### Section 10: Automated Operations & Maintenance
- [x] **Automated Retraining:** Create a script (`scripts/retrain_model.py`) that automatically retrains the model on a schedule with a rolling data window.
- [x] **Data Integrity Monitoring:** Add robust checks for data gaps, stale data, and anomalies (zero volume, price spikes) in `smartcfd/data_loader.py`.
- [x] **Deployment & Scheduling:** Provide clear documentation for scheduling the trading and retraining scripts on both Windows (`Task Scheduler`) and Linux (`cron`).

## ðŸŒŸ Phase 3: Production Readiness & Advanced Features (Current)

### Section 11: Security & Real-Money Trading
- [x] **Security Hardening:** Review and harden the application, ensuring API keys and other secrets are handled securely using a `.env` file.
- [x] **Enhanced Production Logging:** Implemented detailed, structured logging across all major components (Trader, Strategy, Risk, Alpaca Client) to ensure full observability for live operations.
- [x] **State Reconciliation:** Implemented a central `PortfolioManager` to act as a single source of truth for account state (positions, equity), preventing redundant API calls and ensuring data consistency across all components.
- [x] **Live Trading Preparation:** Add final checks and balances before enabling real-money trading, such as final confirmation prompts or improved logging for live trades.

### Section 12: Testing & Validation
- [x] **Unit & Integration Testing for State Management:** Write comprehensive tests for the new `PortfolioManager` and verify that `Trader`, `RiskManager`, and `Strategy` all interact correctly with the centralized state.

### Section 13: Advanced Strategies & Portfolio Management
- [x] **Multi-Asset Trading:** Adapt the system to trade multiple symbols/assets concurrently.
- [x] **Portfolio Management:** Implement logic to manage a portfolio of assets, considering overall risk and allocation.
    - [x] **Fix Test Suite:** Repair unit and integration tests broken by recent refactoring of risk and portfolio logic.
- [x] **Short Selling:** Add the capability to take short positions.
- [x] **Regime Change Detection:** Research and implement a mechanism to detect shifts in market behavior, potentially allowing the bot to switch between different models or strategies.
- [x] **Robust Backtesting Engine:** Build a more comprehensive backtester to rapidly and accurately validate new strategies against historical data before live deployment.

### Section 14: Production & Deployment
- [ ] **Cloud Deployment:** Migrate the application to a cloud VM (e.g., AWS EC2, DigitalOcean Droplet) for 24/7 autonomous operation.
- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically test and deploy new versions of the bot.

## ðŸ“š Phase 4: Review & Strategy (Upcoming)

### Section 15: Comprehensive Review
- [ ] **SWOT Analysis:** Conduct a SWOT analysis to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to the trading bot and its performance.
- [ ] **Lessons Learned:** Document lessons learned throughout the project, focusing on key takeaways that can inform future development and trading strategies.
- [ ] **Performance Review:** Evaluate the trading bot's performance against initial objectives and benchmarks, identifying areas for improvement.

### Section 16: Strategic Planning
- [ ] **Roadmap Revision:** Revise the project roadmap based on the comprehensive review, prioritizing high-impact improvements and features.
- [ ] **Long-term Strategy Development:** Develop a long-term strategy for the trading bot, considering market trends, technological advancements, and potential expansion opportunities.
- [ ] **Resource Allocation Planning:** Plan for resource allocation (time, budget, personnel) required to execute the revised roadmap and long-term strategy.
