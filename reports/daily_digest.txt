Next steps for you:
1. Open your broker dashboard. Confirm the entry price and set the stop-loss and target shown above.
2. If this is paper trading only, simply observe how the positions behave and take notes.
3. Got an alert that says 'Data download failed'? That just means the data feed was busy. The next scheduled run will try again automatically.

Glossary (plain language):
- ATR: tells us how much the price tends to move. Bigger ATR → we buy fewer shares.
- Stop-loss: automatic exit if price goes the wrong way, keeps losses capped.
- Take-profit: automatic exit when the price reaches the goal.
- ADX: measures trend strength. Higher number usually means a stronger trend.
