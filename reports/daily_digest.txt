How are we doing?
- Total closed trades so far: Wins 0, Losses 0, Open 0

- ATR: measures how much the price usually moves; bigger ATR = smaller position size.
- Stop-loss: automatic exit if price moves against us too far.
- Take-profit: automatic exit when price hits our goal.
- ADX: trend strength indicator; higher values usually mean a stronger trend.
