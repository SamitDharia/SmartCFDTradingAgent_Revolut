## âœ… Phase 3: Core Engine & Foundations (Completed)

*   **[x] Section 11: Production Stability:** Hardened security, centralized state with `PortfolioManager`, and stabilized the Docker container.
*   **[x] Section 12: Foundational Features:**
    *   **[x] Multi-Asset Architecture:** Core components (`Trader`, `PortfolioManager`) can handle multiple assets.
    *   **[x] Automated Retraining:** Implemented a complete pipeline in `scripts/retrain_model.py` to retrain the model on a rolling basis.
    *   **[x] Feature Engineering Pipeline:** Implemented a comprehensive set of technical indicators in `smartcfd/indicators.py`.
    *   **[x] Model Tuning Pipeline:** Created a systematic process for hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation.
    *   **[x] Initial Regime Detection:** Created a `RegimeDetector` class.
    *   **[x] Basic Backtesting Script:** Created a `backtest.py` script with Sharpe Ratio and Max Drawdown.

## âœ… Phase 4: Advanced Intelligence & Risk Management (Completed)

*This phase added critical sophistication to the trading engine.*

*   **[x] Section 13: Advanced Order & Risk Management:** Implemented dynamic stop-loss (ATR-based), take-profit orders, and full short-selling capabilities.
*   **[x] Section 14: Advanced Strategies:** Developed a regime-aware strategy and laid the groundwork for portfolio-level logic.
*   **[x] Section 15: Testing & Validation:** Achieved 100% test coverage across the entire codebase, including complex integration tests, ensuring maximum stability.

## ðŸš€ Phase 5: Production & Deployment (Current)

*This phase is about moving the agent from a development environment to a live, autonomous system.*

### Section 16: Cloud Deployment & Automation
- [ ] **Goal:** Migrate the application to a cloud VM for 24/7 autonomous operation.
- [ ] **Task 1:** Set up a production-ready environment on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS EC2, DigitalOcean).
- [ ] **Task 2:** Implement a robust CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.

### Section 17: Advanced Feature Integration
- [ ] **Goal:** Enhance the model's predictive power and system resilience.
- [ ] **Task 1 (Data):** Research and integrate a non-price-based data source (e.g., news sentiment, on-chain metrics).
- [ ] **Task 2 (Backtesting):** Add advanced backtesting metrics (Sortino, Calmar) and simulate transaction costs.
- [ ] **Task 3 (Resilience):** Implement a "circuit breaker" for data fetching. This will track consecutive data failures for each asset, log a `CRITICAL` error if a threshold is breached, and send an email alert to notify of a persistent data outage.
- [ ] **Task 4 (Data Redundancy):** Implement a failover mechanism to switch to a secondary data provider (e.g., Binance, Tiingo) if the primary (Alpaca) fails.
- [ ] **Task 5 (Data Backfilling):** Create a mechanism to automatically fetch and process any missing data after a temporary outage is resolved.

## ðŸ“š Phase 6: Documentation & Review (Ongoing)

### Section 18: Continuous Improvement
- [ ] **Performance Review:** Continuously evaluate the trading bot's performance against backtest results and benchmarks.
- [ ] **Roadmap Revision:** Revise the project roadmap based on new findings and priorities.
- [x] **Documentation:** Keep all project documents (`PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`, `LESSONS_LEARNED.md`, etc.) up-to-date with the latest developments.
