## ‚úÖ Phase 3: Core Engine & Foundations (Completed)

*   **[x] Section 11: Production Stability:** Hardened security, centralized state with `PortfolioManager`, and stabilized the Docker container.
*   **[x] Section 12: Foundational Features:**
    *   **[x] Multi-Asset Architecture:** Core components (`Trader`, `PortfolioManager`) can handle multiple assets.
    *   **[x] Automated Retraining:** Implemented a complete pipeline in `scripts/retrain_model.py` to retrain the model on a rolling basis.
    *   **[x] Feature Engineering Pipeline:** Implemented a comprehensive set of technical indicators in `smartcfd/indicators.py`.
    *   **[x] Model Tuning Pipeline:** Created a systematic process for hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation.
    *   **[x] Initial Regime Detection:** Created a `RegimeDetector` class.
    *   **[x] Basic Backtesting Script:** Created a `backtest.py` script with Sharpe Ratio and Max Drawdown.

## üöÄ Phase 4: Advanced Intelligence & Risk Management (Current)

*This phase is about adding sophistication to the completed foundations.*

### Section 13: Implement Advanced Order & Risk Management
- [x] **Goal:** Implement critical risk management features at the trade level.
- [x] **Task 1:** Implement dynamic stop-loss orders (e.g., based on ATR).
- [x] **Task 2:** Implement take-profit orders.
- [x] **Task 3:** Implement short selling capability.

### Section 14: Develop Advanced Strategies
- [x] **Goal:** Create strategies that are more intelligent than the current single-step model.
- [x] **Task 1:** Create a strategy that uses the `RegimeDetector`'s output to change its behavior.
- [x] **Task 2:** Develop a true portfolio-level strategy that considers cross-asset correlations.

### Section 15: Enhance Backtesting & Feature Set
- [ ] **Goal:** Improve our validation framework and the predictive power of our model.
- [ ] **Task 1 (Backtesting):** Add advanced metrics (Sortino, Calmar) and simulate transaction costs.
- [ ] **Task 2 (Features):** Research and integrate a new, non-price-based data source (e.g., sentiment, on-chain data).

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Phase 5: Production & Deployment (Upcoming)

### Section 17: Cloud Deployment & Automation
- [ ] **Cloud Deployment:** Migrate the application to a cloud VM (e.g., AWS EC2, DigitalOcean Droplet) for 24/7 autonomous operation.
- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically test, backtest, and deploy new versions of the bot.

---

## üìö Phase 6: Documentation & Review (Ongoing)

### Section 18: Continuous Improvement
- [ ] **Performance Review:** Continuously evaluate the trading bot's performance against backtest results and benchmarks.
- [ ] **Roadmap Revision:** Revise the project roadmap based on new findings and priorities.
- [ ] **Documentation:** Keep all project documents (`PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`, `LESSONS_LEARNED.md`, etc.) up-to-date with the latest developments.
