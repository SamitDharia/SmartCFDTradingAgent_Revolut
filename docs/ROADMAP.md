## âœ… Phase 3: Core Engine & Foundations (Completed)

*   **[x] Section 11: Production Stability:** Hardened security, centralized state with `PortfolioManager`, and stabilized the Docker container.
*   **[x] Section 12: Foundational Features:**
    *   **[x] Multi-Asset Architecture:** Core components (`Trader`, `PortfolioManager`) can handle multiple assets.
    *   **[x] Automated Retraining:** Implemented a complete pipeline in `scripts/retrain_model.py` to retrain the model on a rolling basis.
    *   **[x] Feature Engineering Pipeline:** Implemented a comprehensive set of technical indicators in `smartcfd/indicators.py`.
    *   **[x] Model Tuning Pipeline:** Created a systematic process for hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation.
    *   **[x] Initial Regime Detection:** Created a `RegimeDetector` class.
    *   **[x] Basic Backtesting Script:** Created a `backtest.py` script with Sharpe Ratio and Max Drawdown.

## ðŸš€ Phase 5: Production & Deployment (Current)

*This phase is about moving the agent from a development environment to a live, autonomous system.*

### Section 16: Cloud Deployment & Automation
- [ ] **Goal:** Migrate the application to a cloud VM for 24/7 autonomous operation.
- [ ] **Task 1:** Set up a production-ready environment on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS EC2, DigitalOcean).
- [ ] **Task 2:** Implement a robust CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.

### Section 17: Advanced Feature Integration
- [ ] **Goal:** Enhance the model's predictive power with new data sources.
- [ ] **Task 1:** Research and integrate a non-price-based data source (e.g., news sentiment, on-chain metrics).
- [ ] **Task 2:** Add advanced backtesting metrics (Sortino, Calmar) and simulate transaction costs.

## ðŸ“š Phase 6: Documentation & Review (Ongoing)

### Section 18: Continuous Improvement
- [ ] **Performance Review:** Continuously evaluate the trading bot's performance against backtest results and benchmarks.
- [ ] **Roadmap Revision:** Revise the project roadmap based on new findings and priorities.
- [x] **Documentation:** Keep all project documents (`PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`, `LESSONS_LEARNED.md`, etc.) up-to-date with the latest developments.
