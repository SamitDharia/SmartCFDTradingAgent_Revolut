# Development Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic development phases for the Smart CFD Trading Agent, reflecting the project's evolution from inception to its current state.

---

### Phase 1: Core Functionality & Foundation (Completed)

This phase established the project's groundwork and core architecture.

- [x] **Initial Setup**: Configured the development environment with Docker, Git, and VS Code.
- [x] **Modular Architecture**: Designed and implemented the core classes: `Broker`, `Strategy`, `RiskManager`, and `PortfolioManager`.
- [x] **Alpaca Integration**: Connected to the Alpaca paper trading API for market data and order execution.
- [x] **Baseline ML Model**: Created an initial machine learning pipeline using `RandomForestClassifier`.
- [x] **Containerization**: Dockerized the application for portable and reproducible deployment.
- [x] **Basic Logging**: Implemented structured logging to monitor the application's behavior.

### Phase 2: Intelligence & Safety (Completed)

This phase focused on enhancing the model's intelligence and implementing critical safety mechanisms.

- [x] **Advanced Modeling**: Upgraded the model from `RandomForestClassifier` to a tuned `XGBoost` classifier for better performance.
- [x] **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Implemented a systematic process for finding the best model parameters using `RandomizedSearchCV`.
- [x] **Feature Engineering**: Enhanced the feature set with a wide array of technical indicators (Bollinger Bands, MACD, RSI, etc.).
- [x] **Volatility Circuit Breaker**: Implemented an ATR-based mechanism in the `RiskManager` to halt trading during extreme market volatility.
- [x] **Overfitting Mitigation**: Used `TimeSeriesSplit` for cross-validation to build more generalizable models.
- [x] **Data Integrity Monitoring**: Added robust checks for data gaps, stale data, and anomalies to prevent trading on bad data.

---

### Phase 3: Automation, Reporting & Testing (Completed)

This phase automated key processes and built a robust validation framework.

- [x] **Automated Retraining Pipeline**: Created a script (`scripts/retrain_model.py`) to automatically retrain the model on a rolling basis.
- [x] **Daily Digest Reporting**: Implemented a script (`scripts/daily_summary.py`) to generate and email a daily performance summary.
- [x] **Backtesting Engine**: Built a script (`scripts/backtest.py`) to evaluate strategy performance on historical data.
- [x] **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Achieved high test coverage with `pytest`, including a full integration test (`tests/test_full_system_run.py`) to validate the entire trading loop.
- [x] **State Management & Debugging**: Centralized portfolio state management and resolved complex bugs related to environment, configuration, and data flow.
- [x] **Intelligent Health Checks**: Implemented a `/healthz` endpoint that performs a full check on all critical components before reporting a healthy status.

---

### Phase 4: Advanced Trading & Production Hardening (V1.0 - Completed)

This phase introduced sophisticated trading logic and hardened the system for stability, culminating in the V1.0 release.

- [x] **Market Regime Detection**: Implemented a `RegimeDetector` to classify market conditions, allowing the strategy to adapt.
- [x] **Multi-Symbol Trading**: Enabled the agent to trade multiple symbols concurrently, with risk managed on a per-trade basis.
- [x] **Advanced Risk Management**: Implemented dynamic, ATR-based stop-loss and take-profit orders, with position sizes calculated based on a fixed risk percentage.
- [x] **Real-time Data Handling**: Switched to using the `get_crypto_snapshot` endpoint for live data to ensure accuracy and prevent trading on partial bars.
- [x] **Code Hardening & Stability**: Performed extensive data validation, error handling, and stability fixes based on integration test findings and live paper trading. This included a deep debugging session to resolve a cascade of interacting issues, resulting in a truly stable system.
- [x] **Startup Grace Period**: Added a 60-second grace period to the health check to prevent failures during application initialization in Docker.

### Phase 5: Live Operations & Continuous Improvement (Post V1.0)

This phase focuses on deploying the V1.0 agent, monitoring its performance, and continuously improving its capabilities.

- [ ] **Comprehensive Peer Review & Code Audit**: Conduct a thorough peer review of the entire codebase, focusing on logic, security, and adherence to best practices. Engage a third-party expert to audit the strategy and risk management components before deploying with real capital.
- [ ] **Data Feed Redundancy & Health**: Decouple data from execution. Integrate a primary, exchange-native data feed (e.g., Kraken, Coinbase) and use Alpaca as a fallback and for order execution. Implement a "data-health gate" to validate data quality in real-time and backfill gaps.
- [ ] **Enhanced Monitoring and Alerting**: Implement a more sophisticated monitoring solution (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana) and set up alerts for critical events like failed trades, significant losses, or data feed interruptions.
- [ ] **Cloud Deployment & CI/CD**: Deploy the agent to a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, GCP) and establish a continuous integration and deployment pipeline for automated testing and deployment of new versions.
- [ ] **Live Trading**: After extensive testing and validation in the paper environment, transition the agent to live trading with real capital, starting with a small, controlled allocation.

### Version 2.0: Autonomous Intelligence (Future Vision)

This version will build upon the stable foundation of Version 1.0, introducing more sophisticated and autonomous features.

- [ ] **Dynamic Model & Strategy Switching**: Implement a master-model that dynamically selects the most appropriate underlying ML model or trading strategy (e.g., momentum, mean-reversion) based on the current detected market regime.
- [ ] **Portfolio-Level Optimization**: Evolve the agent from single-asset trading to true portfolio management. Use Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to optimize capital allocation across a basket of assets to maximize the portfolio's overall risk-adjusted return.
- [ ] **Alternative Data Integration**: Integrate non-price-based data sources, such as news sentiment analysis or on-chain blockchain metrics, to provide the model with a richer, more predictive feature set.
- [ ] **Explainable AI (XAI) for Trading Decisions**: Integrate tools like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to provide clear, visual explanations for why the model made a specific trade decision, enhancing trust and debuggability.
- [ ] **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Core**: As the ultimate evolution, research and implement a Reinforcement Learning agent that learns an optimal trading policy directly from market interaction, moving beyond simple prediction to holistic decision-making.
- [ ] **Formal Quantitative Modeling & Alpha Research**: Transition from a pure ML-based approach to a hybrid quant model. Systematically research, test, and validate specific "alpha factors" (e.g., momentum, mean-reversion, value). Develop a factor-based model that can weigh these different signals, providing a more robust and explainable foundation for trading decisions than a black-box model alone.
