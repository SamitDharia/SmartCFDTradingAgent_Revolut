- [x] **Volatility Circuit Breaker**: Implement an ATR-based mechanism in the `RiskManager` to halt trading during extreme market volatility.
- [x] **Overfitting Mitigation**: Use `TimeSeriesSplit` for cross-validation to build more generalizable models.
- [x] **Data Integrity Monitoring**: Add robust checks for data gaps, stale data, and anomalies to prevent trading on bad data.

### Phase 3: Automation & Reporting (Completed)

- [x] **Automated Retraining Pipeline**: Create a script (`scripts/retrain_model.py`) to automatically retrain the model on a rolling basis.
- [x] **Daily Digest Reporting**: Implement a script (`scripts/daily_summary.py`) to generate and email a daily performance summary.
- [x] **Backtesting Engine**: Build a script (`scripts/backtest.py`) to evaluate strategy performance on historical data.
- [x] **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Achieve high test coverage with `pytest` to ensure code reliability and prevent regressions.
- [x] **State Management & Debugging**: Centralize portfolio state management and resolve complex bugs related to environment, configuration, and data flow.
- [x] **Health Check Endpoint**: Implement a `/healthz` endpoint to monitor the application's health status.

### Phase 4: Advanced Trade & Risk Management (Completed)

- [x] **Multi-Symbol Trading**: The agent is capable of trading multiple symbols concurrently, with risk managed on a per-trade basis.
- [x] **Advanced Risk Management**: All trades are protected by dynamic, ATR-based stop-loss and take-profit orders, with position sizes calculated based on a fixed risk percentage of the portfolio.
- [x] **Market Regime Detection**: Implement a `RegimeDetector` to classify market conditions (e.g., Bullish, Bearish) and allow the strategy to adapt.

### Phase 5: Production Hardening & Deployment (In Progress)

- [x] **Startup Grace Period**: Implement a grace period for the health check to allow the application to stabilize during startup.
- [ ] **Enhanced Monitoring and Alerting**: Implement a more sophisticated monitoring solution (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana) and set up alerts for critical events.
- [ ] **Cloud Deployment & CI/CD**: Deploy the agent to a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, GCP) and establish a continuous integration and deployment pipeline.
- [ ] **Live Trading**: After extensive testing and validation in the paper environment, transition the agent to live trading with real capital.
oduction Stability:** Hardened security, centralized state with `PortfolioManager`, and stabilized the Docker container.
*   **[x] Section 12: Foundational Features:**
    *   **[x] Multi-Asset Architecture:** Core components (`Trader`, `PortfolioManager`) can handle multiple assets.
    *   **[x] Automated Retraining:** Implemented a complete pipeline in `scripts/retrain_model.py` to retrain the model on a rolling basis.
    *   **[x] Feature Engineering Pipeline:** Implemented a comprehensive set of technical indicators in `smartcfd/indicators.py`.
    *   **[x] Model Tuning Pipeline:** Created a systematic process for hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation.
    *   **[x] Initial Regime Detection:** Created a `RegimeDetector` class.
    *   **[x] Basic Backtesting Script:** Created a `backtest.py` script with Sharpe Ratio and Max Drawdown.

## ‚úÖ Phase 4: Advanced Intelligence & Risk Management (Completed)

*This phase added critical sophistication to the trading engine.*

*   **[x] Section 13: Advanced Order & Risk Management:** Implemented dynamic stop-loss (ATR-based), take-profit orders, and full short-selling capabilities.
*   **[x] Section 14: Advanced Strategies:** Developed a regime-aware strategy and laid the groundwork for portfolio-level logic.
*   **[x] Section 15: Testing & Validation:** Achieved 100% test coverage across the entire codebase, including complex integration tests, ensuring maximum stability.

## üöÄ Phase 5: Stability & Hardening (Current)

*This phase is focused on achieving rock-solid stability and resilience before full cloud deployment.*

### Section 16: Systematic Testing & Validation
- [ ] **Goal:** Prove the application's logic is sound in a controlled environment before deploying to Docker.
- [ ] **Task 1 (Local-First Testing):** Create a comprehensive integration test (`tests/test_full_system_run.py`) that simulates the entire trading loop locally. This test will mock all external API calls to validate the system's behavior under various conditions (e.g., good data, empty data, API errors).
- [ ] **Task 2 (Code Hardening):** Based on the integration test results, add robust data validation and error handling throughout the application. Ensure the system fails gracefully and logs clear, actionable errors.
- [ ] **Task 3 (Intelligent Health Checks):** Improve the `/healthz` endpoint to perform a full check on all critical components (e.g., broker connection, data source availability) before reporting a `200 OK` status.

### Section 17: Advanced Feature Integration & Cloud Prep
- [ ] **Goal:** Enhance the model's predictive power and prepare for autonomous operation.
- [ ] **Task 1 (Data):** Research and integrate a non-price-based data source (e.g., news sentiment, on-chain metrics).
- [ ] **Task 2 (Backtesting):** Add advanced backtesting metrics (Sortino, Calmar) and simulate transaction costs.
- [ ] **Task 3 (Data Redundancy):** Implement a failover mechanism to switch to a secondary data provider (e.g., Binance, Tiingo) if the primary (Alpaca) fails.
- [ ] **Task 4 (Data Backfilling):** Create a mechanism to automatically fetch and process any missing data after a temporary outage is resolved.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Phase 6: Cloud Deployment & Automation

### Section 18: Production Migration
- [ ] **Goal:** Migrate the application to a cloud VM for 24/7 autonomous operation.
- [ ] **Task 1:** Set up a production-ready environment on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS EC2, DigitalOcean).
- [ ] **Task 2:** Implement a robust CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.

---

## üìö Phase 7: Documentation & Review (Ongoing)

### Section 19: Continuous Improvement
- [ ] **Performance Review:** Continuously evaluate the trading bot's performance against backtest results and benchmarks.
- [ ] **Roadmap Revision:** Revise the project roadmap based on new findings and priorities.
- [x] **Documentation:** Keep all project documents (`PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`, `LESSONS_LEARNED.md`, etc.) up-to-date with the latest developments.

---

## üîß Phase 8: Live Data Handling & Final Polish

- **[ ] Implement Snapshot Data Fetching**: Modify the `DataLoader` to use the `get_crypto_snapshot` endpoint instead of relying solely on historical bar requests. This will prevent issues with partial, incomplete live bars and provide more accurate, up-to-the-minute data for decision-making.
- **[ ] Final Code Review & Cleanup**: Perform a full review of the new code, add comments, and ensure all configurations are production-ready.
- **[ ] Long-Duration Test in Docker**: Run the agent in Docker for an extended period (e.g., 12-24 hours) to monitor for any memory leaks, performance degradation, or other long-term stability issues.
- **[ ] Final Deployment Documentation**: Update `README-DEPLOY.md` with the final, verified steps for deploying and managing the production agent.

---

## Phase 4: Production Hardening & Advanced Features

- [ ] **Enhanced Monitoring and Alerting**: Implement a more sophisticated monitoring solution (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana) and set up alerts for critical events like repeated trade failures, significant drawdowns, or prolonged data feed issues.
- [ ] **Cloud Deployment & CI/CD**: Deploy the agent to a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, GCP) and establish a continuous integration and deployment pipeline for automated testing and releases.
- [ ] **Multi-Symbol Trading**: Expand the agent's capability to trade multiple symbols concurrently, including portfolio-level risk management.
- [ ] **Advanced Risk Management**: Introduce more sophisticated risk models, such as portfolio-level VaR (Value at Risk) calculations.
- [ ] **Live Trading**: After extensive testing and validation in the paper environment, transition the agent to live trading with real capital.
