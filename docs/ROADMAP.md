## ‚úÖ Phase 3: Core Engine & Foundations (Completed)

*   **[x] Section 11: Production Stability:** Hardened security, centralized state with `PortfolioManager`, and stabilized the Docker container.
*   **[x] Section 12: Foundational Features:**
    *   **[x] Multi-Asset Architecture:** Core components (`Trader`, `PortfolioManager`) can handle multiple assets.
    *   **[x] Automated Retraining:** Implemented a complete pipeline in `scripts/retrain_model.py` to retrain the model on a rolling basis.
    *   **[x] Feature Engineering Pipeline:** Implemented a comprehensive set of technical indicators in `smartcfd/indicators.py`.
    *   **[x] Model Tuning Pipeline:** Created a systematic process for hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation.
    *   **[x] Initial Regime Detection:** Created a `RegimeDetector` class.
    *   **[x] Basic Backtesting Script:** Created a `backtest.py` script with Sharpe Ratio and Max Drawdown.

## üöÄ Phase 5: Stability & Hardening (Current)

*This phase is focused on achieving rock-solid stability and resilience before full cloud deployment.*

### Section 16: Systematic Testing & Validation
- [ ] **Goal:** Prove the application's logic is sound in a controlled environment before deploying to Docker.
- [ ] **Task 1 (Local-First Testing):** Create a comprehensive integration test (`tests/test_full_system_run.py`) that simulates the entire trading loop locally. This test will mock all external API calls to validate the system's behavior under various conditions (e.g., good data, empty data, API errors).
- [ ] **Task 2 (Code Hardening):** Based on the integration test results, add robust data validation and error handling throughout the application. Ensure the system fails gracefully and logs clear, actionable errors.
- [ ] **Task 3 (Intelligent Health Checks):** Improve the `/healthz` endpoint to perform a full check on all critical components (e.g., broker connection, data source availability) before reporting a `200 OK` status.

### Section 17: Advanced Feature Integration & Cloud Prep
- [ ] **Goal:** Enhance the model's predictive power and prepare for autonomous operation.
- [ ] **Task 1 (Data):** Research and integrate a non-price-based data source (e.g., news sentiment, on-chain metrics).
- [ ] **Task 2 (Backtesting):** Add advanced backtesting metrics (Sortino, Calmar) and simulate transaction costs.
- [ ] **Task 3 (Data Redundancy):** Implement a failover mechanism to switch to a secondary data provider (e.g., Binance, Tiingo) if the primary (Alpaca) fails.
- [ ] **Task 4 (Data Backfilling):** Create a mechanism to automatically fetch and process any missing data after a temporary outage is resolved.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Phase 6: Cloud Deployment & Automation

### Section 18: Production Migration
- [ ] **Goal:** Migrate the application to a cloud VM for 24/7 autonomous operation.
- [ ] **Task 1:** Set up a production-ready environment on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS EC2, DigitalOcean).
- [ ] **Task 2:** Implement a robust CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.

## üìö Phase 7: Documentation & Review (Ongoing)

### Section 19: Continuous Improvement
- [ ] **Performance Review:** Continuously evaluate the trading bot's performance against backtest results and benchmarks.
- [ ] **Roadmap Revision:** Revise the project roadmap based on new findings and priorities.
- [x] **Documentation:** Keep all project documents (`PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`, `LESSONS_LEARNED.md`, etc.) up-to-date with the latest developments.

---

## üîß Phase 8: Live Data Handling & Final Polish

- **[ ] Implement Snapshot Data Fetching**: Modify the `DataLoader` to use the `get_crypto_snapshot` endpoint instead of relying solely on historical bar requests. This will prevent issues with partial, incomplete live bars and provide more accurate, up-to-the-minute data for decision-making.
- **[ ] Final Code Review & Cleanup**: Perform a full review of the new code, add comments, and ensure all configurations are production-ready.
- **[ ] Long-Duration Test in Docker**: Run the agent in Docker for an extended period (e.g., 12-24 hours) to monitor for any memory leaks, performance degradation, or other long-term stability issues.
- **[ ] Final Deployment Documentation**: Update `README-DEPLOY.md` with the final, verified steps for deploying and managing the production agent.
