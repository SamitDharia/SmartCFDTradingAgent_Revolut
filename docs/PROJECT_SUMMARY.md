# Project Summary: Smart CFD Trading Agent

## High-Level Summary
This project is an autonomous trading agent that uses machine learning to analyze market data, generate trading signals, and manage risk, with full integration for paper and live trading via the Alpaca Markets API. It is designed for continuous, unattended operation and is fully containerized with Docker for portability and reliability. The system has evolved from a baseline model to an advanced agent with sophisticated safety mechanisms and automated maintenance features.

## Key Objectives
*   **Autonomous Trading:** Create a hands-off system capable of executing a trading strategy 24/7.
*   **Data-Driven Decisions:** Use machine learning (XGBoost) to identify predictive patterns in market data.
*   **Robust Architecture:** Build a resilient, scalable, and maintainable system with professional software engineering practices.
*   **Comprehensive Risk Management:** Integrate a sophisticated risk layer to protect capital by enforcing rules on position sizing, daily drawdown, and market volatility.

## Core Technologies
*   **Programming Language:** Python
*   **Machine Learning:** XGBoost, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
*   **Trading & Data:** Alpaca Markets API
*   **Deployment:** Docker, Docker Compose
*   **Development:** Git, Pytest, VS Code

## Key Features & Achievements

### Phase 1: Core Functionality & Foundation (Completed)
*   **Modular Architecture:** A clean, object-oriented design separating the `Broker` (market interaction), `Strategy` (decision logic), and `RiskManager` (safety).
*   **Live Paper Trading:** Successful integration with the Alpaca paper trading platform.
*   **Baseline ML Pipeline:** An end-to-end pipeline for data loading, training, and inference using an initial `RandomForestClassifier`.
*   **Dockerized Deployment:** The entire application is containerized, ensuring a portable and reproducible environment.

### Phase 2: Intelligence & Safety (Completed)
*   **Advanced Modeling:** Upgraded the model from `RandomForestClassifier` to a tuned `XGBoost` classifier for better performance and implemented a systematic hyperparameter tuning pipeline.
*   **Rich Feature Engineering:** Enhanced the feature set with a wide array of technical indicators (Bollinger Bands, MACD, RSI, etc.).
*   **Robustness & Safety Mechanisms:**
    -   **Volatility Circuit Breaker:** An ATR-based mechanism in the `RiskManager` that automatically halts trading during extreme market volatility.
    -   **Data Integrity Monitoring:** Robust checks for data gaps, stale data, and anomalies to prevent trading on bad data.
    -   **Overfitting Mitigation:** Use of `TimeSeriesSplit` for cross-validation to build more generalizable models.

### Phase 3: Automation & Reporting (Completed)
*   **Automated Retraining Pipeline:** A script that automatically retrains the model on a rolling data window to adapt to new market conditions.
*   **Backtesting Engine:** A script to evaluate strategy performance on historical data, including key metrics and visualizations.
*   **Comprehensive Reporting:** A daily email digest summarizing trades and performance, and a web-based dashboard for real-time visualization.
*   **Full Test Coverage & Stability:** Achieved high test coverage with a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests, ensuring maximum stability and reliability.
*   **Health Monitoring:** A `/healthz` endpoint to provide real-time status of the application's core components.

### Phase 4: Production Hardening & Advanced Features (In Progress)
*   **Production Stability:** Implemented a startup grace period for health checks, ensuring the application can stabilize in a containerized environment.
*   **Current Focus:** The project is now focused on preparing for full production deployment, including enhanced monitoring, cloud deployment, and CI/CD automation.

## Your Role: Project Lead & Strategist
As the driving force behind the project, your role has been to:
*   **Set the Vision & Strategy:** You defined the project's goals, strategic direction, and managed the roadmap.
*   **Architectural Oversight:** You guided the high-level architectural design and made critical decisions at every phase.
*   **Code Review & Validation:** You actively reviewed the implementation, validated the bot's behavior, and directed the systematic resolution of complex bugs.

## My Role: AI Development Partner
As the AI programming assistant, my role has been to:
*   **Implement the Vision:** Translate your strategic goals into functional, tested, and robust code.
*   **Code Generation & Refactoring:** Write, refactor, and debug code across the stack.
*   **Systematic Troubleshooting:** Systematically identify and resolve technical issues, providing detailed analysis and solutions.
*   **Documentation:** Maintain and update the project's living documents to reflect the current state and learnings.
