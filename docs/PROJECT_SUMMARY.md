# Project Summary: Smart CFD Trading Agent

## High-Level Summary
This project is an autonomous trading agent that uses machine learning to analyze market data, generate trading signals, and manage risk, with full integration for paper and live trading via the Alpaca Markets API. It is designed for continuous, unattended operation and is fully containerized with Docker for portability and reliability. The system has evolved from a baseline model to an advanced, stable agent with sophisticated safety mechanisms and automated maintenance features.

## Key Objectives
*   **Autonomous Trading:** Create a hands-off system capable of executing a trading strategy 24/7.
*   **Data-Driven Decisions:** Use machine learning (XGBoost) to identify predictive patterns in market data.
*   **Robust Architecture:** Build a resilient, scalable, and maintainable system with professional software engineering practices.
*   **Comprehensive Risk Management:** Integrate a sophisticated risk layer to protect capital by enforcing rules on position sizing, dynamic stop-losses, and market volatility.

## Core Technologies
*   **Programming Language:** Python
*   **Machine Learning:** XGBoost, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
*   **Trading & Data:** Alpaca Markets API
*   **Deployment:** Docker, Docker Compose
*   **Development:** Git, Pytest, VS Code

## Key Features & Achievements

### Phase 1: Core Functionality & Foundation (Completed)
*   **Modular Architecture:** A clean, object-oriented design separating the `Broker`, `Strategy`, `RiskManager`, and `PortfolioManager`.
*   **Live Paper Trading:** Successful integration with the Alpaca paper trading platform.
*   **Baseline ML Pipeline:** An end-to-end pipeline for data loading, training, and inference using an initial `RandomForestClassifier`.
*   **Dockerized Deployment:** The entire application is containerized, ensuring a portable and reproducible environment.

### Phase 2: Intelligence & Safety (Completed)
*   **Advanced Modeling:** Upgraded the model to a tuned `XGBoost` classifier and implemented a systematic hyperparameter tuning pipeline.
*   **Rich Feature Engineering:** Enhanced the feature set with a wide array of technical indicators.
*   **Robustness & Safety Mechanisms:**
    -   **Volatility Circuit Breaker:** An ATR-based mechanism to automatically halt trading during extreme market volatility.
    -   **Data Integrity Monitoring:** Robust checks for data gaps, stale data, and anomalies.
    -   **Overfitting Mitigation:** Use of `TimeSeriesSplit` for cross-validation to build more generalizable models.

### Phase 3: Automation, Reporting & Testing (Completed)
*   **Automated Retraining Pipeline:** A script that automatically retrains the model on a rolling data window.
*   **Backtesting Engine:** A script to evaluate strategy performance on historical data.
*   **Daily Digest Reporting:** An automated daily email summary of trades and performance.
*   **Full Test Coverage:** High test coverage with a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests.
*   **Intelligent Health Monitoring:** A `/healthz` endpoint to provide real-time status of the application's core components.

### Phase 4: Advanced Trading & Production Hardening (Completed)
*   **Advanced Strategy:** Implemented a `RegimeDetector` to allow the strategy to adapt to changing market conditions.
*   **Advanced Risk Management:** All trades are protected by dynamic, ATR-based stop-loss and take-profit orders, with position sizes calculated based on a fixed risk percentage.
*   **Multi-Symbol Trading:** The agent is capable of trading multiple symbols concurrently.
*   **Production Stability:** Implemented a startup grace period for health checks and switched to snapshot data fetching to ensure the system is stable and trades on the most accurate live data.

### Version 1.0: Stable & Autonomous (Current)
*   **Current Status:** The agent is feature-complete, stable, and fully autonomous. All core systems have been validated in a live paper-trading environment.
*   **Key Outcome:** The project has successfully achieved its primary goal of creating a reliable, hands-off trading agent that can operate continuously.

### Version 2.0: Advanced Capabilities (Future Vision)
*   **Next Steps:** Building on the stable V1.0 foundation, future work will focus on implementing more sophisticated features, such as portfolio-level optimization, dynamic strategy switching, and integrating alternative data sources. See the `ROADMAP.md` for a full breakdown.

## Your Role: Project Lead & Strategist
As the driving force behind the project, your role has been to:
*   **Set the Vision & Strategy:** You defined the project's goals, strategic direction, and managed the roadmap.
*   **Architectural Oversight:** You guided the high-level architectural design and made critical decisions at every phase.
*   **Code Review & Validation:** You actively reviewed the implementation, validated the bot's behavior, and directed the systematic resolution of complex bugs.

## My Role: AI Development Partner
As the AI programming assistant, my role has been to:
*   **Implement the Vision:** Translate your strategic goals into functional, tested, and robust code.
*   **Code Generation & Refactoring:** Write, refactor, and debug code across the stack.
*   **Systematic Troubleshooting:** Systematically identify and resolve technical issues, providing detailed analysis and solutions.
*   **Documentation:** Maintain and update the project's living documents to reflect the current state and learnings.
