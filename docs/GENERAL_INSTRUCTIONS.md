# General Project Instructions & Vision

**Mission:**  
To build a fully autonomous, intelligent trading system. The agent will leverage machine learning to make data-driven decisions, manage risk, and operate independently in live paper trading environments.

## üß≠ Core Project Documents

This project is guided by a set of living documents that track our progress, plans, and learnings. These are the primary sources of truth for our work:

1.  **[Project Summary (`PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`)](PROJECT_SUMMARY.md)**
    *   **Purpose:** A high-level overview of the project, suitable for resumes and external showcases.
    *   **Content:** Defines the project's objectives, technologies, key achievements, and clearly outlines our respective roles.

2.  **[Development Roadmap (`ROADMAP.md`)](ROADMAP.md)**
    *   **Purpose:** The strategic plan outlining all development phases, from initial setup to future features.
    *   **Content:** Contains a detailed, section-by-section breakdown of tasks. We will follow this roadmap to guide our development priorities.

3.  **[Lessons Learned (`LESSONS_LEARNED.md`)](LESSONS_LEARNED.md)**
    *   **Purpose:** A project retrospective and journal.
    *   **Content:** We continuously update this document with key learnings, mistakes, and important decisions. It helps us reflect on our process and improve as we go.

4.  **[SWOT Analysis (`SWOT_ANALYSIS.md`)](SWOT_ANALYSIS.md)**
    *   **Purpose:** A strategic analysis of the project's internal strengths/weaknesses and external opportunities/threats.
    *   **Content:** Informs the strategic direction and helps prioritize tasks on the roadmap.

##  VISION

### üß† Machine Learning & Strategy Engine
The core of this project is an adaptive strategy engine. The system will:
-   Monitor the performance of its strategies.
-   Incorporate robust risk management, including stop-losses and take-profits.
-   Evolve to potentially adjust parameters or strategies based on performance data.

### üìä Reporting & Monitoring
A key goal is to have clear, data-rich reporting. This includes:
-   A daily digest summarizing trades, performance, and key statistics (P/L, drawdown, etc.).
-   The digest should be professional and clear, suitable for external review.

### ‚ú® Future Ambitions: A Premium Dashboard
While not an immediate priority, a long-term goal is to develop a sleek, modern, and interactive dashboard (e.g., using Streamlit) to visualize the bot's performance and operations in real-time. The design philosophy should be clean and professional.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running the Bot: Environment & Networking

For the trading bot to operate correctly, the following conditions must be met:

1.  **Docker:** The application is containerized with Docker and managed with `docker-compose`. Ensure Docker Desktop is running on your system.
2.  **API Keys:** A valid `.env` file with the correct Alpaca API keys (`APCA_API_KEY_ID` and `APCA_API_SECRET_KEY`) must be present in the root directory.
3.  **Network Connection:** The bot requires a direct, unfiltered internet connection to communicate with the Alpaca API.
    *   **VPNs:** Corporate or private VPNs will likely cause `SSL certificate verification` errors and must be **turned off**.
    *   **Restrictive Networks:** Some corporate or public WiFi networks may block the necessary connections. If you encounter persistent `NameResolutionError` or other network issues, switch to a less restrictive network, such as a mobile hotspot. The `docker-compose.yml` file has been configured to use public DNS servers to improve reliability, but a restrictive network can still cause problems.

To start the bot in detached mode (runs in the background):
```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

To start the bot and view live logs in the terminal:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

To view the logs of a running container:
```bash
docker-compose logs --tail 100 -f
```

### Core Development Principle: Verify, Don't Assume

A critical lesson learned during the development of this project is the importance of verification over assumption. Multiple errors and significant delays were caused by assuming the location or even the existence of code elements like variables and functions.

**Before writing code that depends on another part of the project, always:**

1.  **Verify Existence**: Use a simple workspace search to confirm that the variable, function, or class you need actually exists.
2.  **Verify Location**: Once you know it exists, confirm the correct file and module path.
3.  **Verify Signature**: Check the function/method signature to ensure you are passing the correct arguments.

This simple, disciplined process prevents `ImportError` and `AttributeError` issues and is much faster than debugging after a failed assumption. For a detailed history of these issues, see the `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` file.
