# Project Summary: Smart CFD Trading Agent

## High-Level Summary
This project involves the design, development, and deployment of a fully autonomous trading bot. The agent leverages machine learning to analyze real-time market data for cryptocurrencies (starting with BTC/USD) and makes independent trading decisions on a live paper trading account. The entire system is containerized with Docker for consistent and reliable deployment.

## Key Objectives
*   **Autonomous Trading:** To create a hands-off system capable of executing a trading strategy 24/7.
*   **Data-Driven Decisions:** To use machine learning to identify predictive patterns in market data, moving beyond simple rule-based trading.
*   **Robust Architecture:** To build a resilient, scalable, and maintainable system with professional software engineering practices, including structured logging, configuration management, and automated testing.
*   **Risk Management:** To integrate a sophisticated risk management layer to protect capital by enforcing rules on position sizing and portfolio-level drawdown.

## Core Technologies
*   **Programming Language:** Python
*   **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
*   **Trading & Data:** Alpaca Markets API
*   **Deployment:** Docker, Docker Compose
*   **Development:** Git, Pytest, VS Code

## Key Achievements to Date
*   **Modular Architecture:** Developed a clean, object-oriented architecture separating concerns for the `Broker` (market interaction), `Strategy` (decision logic), and `RiskManager` (safety).
*   **Live Paper Trading Integration:** Successfully connected the agent to the Alpaca paper trading platform, enabling it to execute trades in a live, simulated environment.
*   **End-to-End ML Pipeline:**
    1.  Built a data loader to fetch historical market data.
    2.  Created a training script for a baseline Random Forest classification model.
    3.  Developed an `InferenceStrategy` that loads the trained model and uses it to generate live predictions.
*   **Dockerized Deployment:** Fully containerized the application, ensuring a portable and reproducible production environment.
*   **Repository Refactoring:** Conducted a comprehensive cleanup of the codebase, removing legacy files and establishing a professional project structure.

## Your Role: Project Lead & Strategist
As the driving force behind the project, your role has been to:
*   **Set the Vision & Strategy:** You defined the project's goals, strategic direction, and scope, making the key decisions on what features to prioritize and the overall trading approach.
*   **Architectural Oversight:** You guided the high-level architectural design, ensuring the system remained modular, scalable, and aligned with the project's long-term objectives.
*   **Critical Decision-Making:** You made crucial decisions at every turn, from selecting the initial trading asset and ML model approach to prioritizing the development of robustness and safety features.
*   **Code Review & Validation:** You actively reviewed the implementation, validated the bot's behavior, and directed the debugging process by identifying issues and steering the corrective action.
*   **Project Management:** You have managed the project's lifecycle, from initial cleanup and setup to ongoing development, by maintaining the roadmap and ensuring the project stays on track.

## My Role: AI Development Partner
As the AI programming assistant, my role has been to:
*   **Implement the Vision:** Translate your strategic goals into functional code, building out the architecture, features, and ML pipeline you designed.
*   **Code Generation & Refactoring:** Write, refactor, and debug code across the stack based on your direction.
*   **Technical Execution:** Handle the hands-on-keyboard tasks of training the model, configuring the Docker environment, and integrating the various components.
*   **Troubleshooting & Analysis:** Systematically identify and resolve technical issues, providing analysis and solutions for your review and approval.
